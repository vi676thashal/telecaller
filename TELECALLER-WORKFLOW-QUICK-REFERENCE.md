# TELECALLER WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT: QUICK REFERENCE

## PROBLEM
The AI was occasionally behaving like a generic assistant instead of following the required 7-step telecaller workflow for credit card sales.

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW
We implemented a comprehensive enforcement system that ensures the AI always behaves like a telecaller and strictly follows the workflow:
1. **Greeting** → 2. **Language** → 3. **Benefits** → 4. **Data Collection** → 5. **Application** → 6. **Confirmation** → 7. **Closing**

## KEY COMPONENTS

### 1. Pattern Detection
- Detects assistant-like phrases (e.g., "How can I help you?")
- Identifies AI self-references (e.g., "I'm an AI")
- Catches generic follow-ups (e.g., "Anything else you need?")

### 2. Workflow Enforcement
- Ensures each step leads to appropriate next step
- Adds missing step elements when needed
- Maintains context-appropriate telecaller phrasing

### 3. Integration Points
- **OpenAI Service**: Strong system prompts + response validation
- **Voice Provider**: Pre-TTS enforcement check
- **Workflow Engine**: Proper context in all LLM calls
- **Response Optimizer**: Pattern detection and replacement

## VERIFICATION TESTS

### Production Monitoring
```
node monitor-telecaller-workflow.js
```
Reviews recent production calls for workflow violations

## VALIDATION QUESTIONS

When examining the system, verify:
1. Does the AI ever ask "How can I help you?" or similar? (Should NEVER happen)
2. Does the AI properly introduce itself as a telecaller for credit card sales? (Should ALWAYS happen)
3. Does the AI consistently move through all 7 steps? (Should ALWAYS follow the workflow)
4. When a customer asks a question, does the AI answer and return to the workflow? (Should ALWAYS happen)
5. Does the AI complete its responses with assistant-like phrases? (Should NEVER happen)
