# SecureVoice AI Telecaller System

A sophisticated AI-powered telecaller system for credit card sales that strictly follows a 7-step workflow, ensuring consistent and effective customer interactions.

## Overview

The SecureVoice AI system simulates a human telecaller for credit card sales, following a structured workflow:
1. **Greeting** → 2. **Language Selection** → 3. **Benefits Presentation** → 4. **Data Collection** → 5. **Application** → 6. **Confirmation** → 7. **Closing**

The system is designed to maintain a strict telecaller persona throughout the entire call flow, never reverting to generic assistant behavior.

## Key Features

- **Strict Workflow Enforcement**: Ensures the AI always follows the 7-step sales process
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports English, Hindi, and Hinglish conversations
- **Natural Human-like Conversations**: Implements conversational markers, pauses, and fillers
- **Question Handling**: Answers customer questions while maintaining the sales flow
- **Objection Handling**: Addresses common objections without derailing the sales process
- **Data Collection**: Systematically collects necessary information for credit card applications
- **Ultra-Fast Response Optimization**: Minimizes latency for natural conversation flow
- **Multi-Bank Support**: Customizable for different financial institutions

## Technical Implementation

- **Voice Processing**: Fast, low-latency speech-to-text and text-to-speech pipelines
- **Language Models**: Integration with OpenAI and Gemini LLMs
- **Pattern Detection**: Comprehensive detection system for maintaining telecaller behavior
- **Workflow Engine**: Advanced state machine for managing conversational flow
- **Response Optimization**: Techniques to reduce latency and maintain natural conversation
- **Monitoring Tools**: Scripts for verifying compliance with telecaller behavior

## Usage
